# lua_integration

Small project with an example integrating Lua into Rust.
This could be handy for configuration, for example configurating a web server.

The executable must be in the same folder as `config.lua` file
```bash
Result from lua:
Hello, my name is Francesco. I am 24 years old and live in Bologna - Italy.
Person { name: "Francesco", age: 24, city: "Bologna - Italy" }

```
